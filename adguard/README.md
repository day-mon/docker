After installing AdGuard home using the `curl` script, I stumbled upon this behavior on Ubuntu 21.10.
In the set-up instructions on the dashboard (127.0.0.1), it was mentioned that port 53 is occupied most likely by `systemd-resolved`.

I followed the provided instructions and it was fixed. In particular:
```
sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d
cd /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d
sudo vim adguardhome.conf
sudo mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.backup
sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
systemctl reload-or-restart systemd-resolved
```

The `adguardhome.conf` file contains:
```
[Resolve]
DNS=127.0.0.1
DNSStubListener=no
```


To get DHCP working on pi config /etc/dhcpd.conf
```
# A sample configuration for dhcpcd.
# See dhcpcd.conf(5) for details.

# Allow users of this group to interact with dhcpcd via the control socket.
#controlgroup wheel

# Inform the DHCP server of our hostname for DDNS.
hostname pi

# Use the hardware address of the interface for the Client ID.
clientid
# or
# Use the same DUID + IAID as set in DHCPv6 for DHCPv4 ClientID as per RFC4361.
# Some non-RFC compliant DHCP servers do not reply with this set.
# In this case, comment out duid and enable clientid above.
#duid

# Persist interface configuration when dhcpcd exits.
persistent

# Rapid commit support.
# Safe to enable by default because it requires the equivalent option set
# on the server to actually work.
option rapid_commit

# A list of options to request from the DHCP server.
option domain_name_servers, domain_name, domain_search, host_name
option classless_static_routes
# Respect the network MTU. This is applied to DHCP routes.
option interface_mtu

# Most distributions have NTP support.
#option ntp_servers

# A ServerID is required by RFC2131.
require dhcp_server_identifier

# Generate SLAAC address using the Hardware Address of the interface
#slaac hwaddr
# OR generate Stable Private IPv6 Addresses based from the DUID
slaac private

# Example static IP configuration:
interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.2/24
#static ip6_address=fd51:42f8:caae:d92e::ff/64
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_severs=1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8
#static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 fd51:42f8:caae:d92e::1

# It is possible to fall back to a static IP if DHCP fails:
# define static profile
#profile static_eth0
#static ip_address=192.168.1.23/24
#static routers=192.168.1.1
#static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1

# fallback to static profile on eth0
#interface eth0
#fallback static_eth0
```

IP Range must start where the last satic ip is. Example last static ip is 192.168.1.2 because 192.168.1.1 is router 192.168.1.2 is device

Enanble DHCP first on Pi then disable in router
